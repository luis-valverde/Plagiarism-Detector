## Introduction

This repository contains all my work for the Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree Program.

## Project Overview

Plagiarim is when you copy/paste and present someone else's work as it was your own, that's considered stealing of
intellectual properties.

In this project, you will be tasked with building a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary
classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar the text file is when compared
to a provided source text. Then, you will deploy your trained model using Amazon SageMaker.

## Requirements

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn (v0.17)](https://scikit-learn.org/0.17/install.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and
more included.

## Neccessary Files
